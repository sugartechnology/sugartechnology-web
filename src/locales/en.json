    "blogGraphSpan": "Decision-making is one of the most challenging aspects of life. The reason behind this difficulty is that the outcomes of our decisions are not always certain, which makes the decision-making process truly challenging. For instance, when it comes to selecting furniture for a new home, the furniture choices need to be compatible with other items in the house. Some examples of these items include curtains, rugs, artwork, and lighting fixtures.",

    "paragraphListSpan1": "If you are in a situation like this, you might wish that you could see how the furniture you want to buy would look in your home before making the purchase. At least, I would like to have such an option. In this blog, I will talk about an application that provides a solution to this very problem.",
    "paragraphListSpan2": "Firstly, the name of the application is Rapid Render. It can provide great convenience for visualizing the design of your room or house. All you need to know is the dimensions of your room or house. When you open the application, you are presented with a blank drawing page...",
    "paragraphListSpan3": "Drawing on this page is not a difficult task at all. All you have to do is draw lines, and the application even helps you with that. In the next step, you can place products from partner stores in any corner or wall of your house in any way you desire.",
    "paragraphListSpan4": "This step only takes 5 minutes, of course, if you have already made a decision about the product ðŸ˜Š After that, you can send a request to the server to obtain a more detailed image of the interior of your home. If you appreciate details, let me show you an example of a room design that I created myself. The drawing of this room took 1 minute, placing the products took 5 minutes, and selecting the curtains and flooring took 3 minutes.",
    "paragraphAuthorSpan": "I started working on programming when I was in high school. So far, I have worked on various fields such as programming, 2D drawing, 3D modeling, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, game development, SQL, and Windows Form applications.",

    "paragraphList2Span1": "Every company needs a catalog to visualize their products. This is a traditional need that many companies have. You can physically build a concept and have high-quality photographs taken in a studio. Alternatively, you can shoot the products individually, use Photoshop to cut them out, and create a successful image with some shadows. You can achieve cost-effectiveness by ensuring reusability.",
    "paragraphList2Span2": "However, marketing now requires a different approach due to viruses and other factors. E-commerce and social media companies expect brands to react to their fast-paced lives like living organisms. They want to see posts from the brands they follow that are relevant to the day's significance and importance. To meet these new needs, you need to visualize your products with different textures, colors, and even within different concepts.",
    "paragraphList2Span3Part1": "Regarding this topic,",
    "paragraphList2Span3Part2": "there is a great article shared here",
    "paragraphList2Span3Part3": "that discusses Netfax's visual strategy for the Stranger Things series based on viewing habits. Assuming that social media and e-commerce are the grocery stores of our time, they want to captivate users.",
    "paragraphList2Span4": "So, how can you implement this strategy? It is evident that setting up a studio, producing the product with new colors and textures, and other traditional methods that require effort and expenses will not sustain this approach. To solve these problems, the concept creation through rendering, preferred by major brands, is becoming more common in Turkey as well.",
    "paragraphList2Span5": "As a company, we provide rendering services and offer our customers our own application, Rapid Render, which includes features such as preview, cloud farm, etc. With Rapid Render, you can obtain the most complex renders in 5 minutes using the Cloud technology in the background. We also inform our customers that the 3D models used in rendering are reusable and can be used in various areas, including Augmented Reality, Web AR, Google Search AR, and more, and we transfer this know-how.",

However, after gaining experience for 4-5 years, I realized that our client wanted the usability of Augmented Reality to be questioned and the usage of the technology to be explained with up-to-date data, rather than just sharing a memory.",
    "blogParagraph3Span2": "In summary, our client wanted to ask the following questions:",
    "blogParagraph3Span3": "This technology has been around for a long time. Is there any new game-changing development in technology?",
    "blogParagraph3Span4": "Even though it has been around for a long time, people are not using it. Why should I invest?",
    "blogParagraph3Span5": "At the end of this series, I hope to help brand officials create roadmaps for transitioning to AR and digitalization technologies. I will start with the most written-about topic and briefly discuss the differences between AR and VR.",
    "blogParagraph3Span6": "What is AR? What are the differences between AR and VR?",
    "blogParagraph3Span7": "AR, short for Augmented Reality, recognizes and allows us to place digital content on real-world areas or objects. The detected content can be a human body, human hair, or even just the floor or sky itself.",
    "blogParagraph3Span8": "AR technology is made possible by artificial intelligence and sensor support. When compared to VR, although it requires more artificial intelligence and sensor requirements, there is no barrier to the widespread adoption of technology due to the fact that our smartphones already provide these capabilities.",
    "blogParagraph3Span9": "VR, on the other hand, stands for Virtual Reality. It isolates us from the real world using goggles or similar technologies and allows us to interact with digital content in a virtual environment. Critical differences between AR and VR are isolation and the necessity of using a device such as smart glasses, which is not part of our daily routine. While we can turn our phones into VR goggles using cardboard and position our hands as a dongle, investing in VR devices is a more rational option.",
    "blogParagraph3Span10": "In our upcoming blog post, we will delve into the detailed differences between AR and VR, explore the investments made by brands in these two technologies, and examine consumer receptiveness. However, before we park the topic and focus on AR technology, let's briefly compare both technologies and address any questions related to AR and how these questions are resolved.",
    "blogParagraph3Span11": "This technology has been around for a long time. What has changed?",
    "blogParagraph3Span12": "Indeed, this technology has been around for a while, but its accessibility to the general public was achieved in 2018. Prior to 2017, QR codes or image markers were used for the technology to function. Due to the lack of sensors and absence of artificial intelligence, spatial mapping did not work properly, and realistic 3D models could not be used due to hardware limitations. In 2017, the technology was introduced for mobile applications with Apple's devices and in 2018, it was made available for web usage as well.",
    "blogParagraph3Span13": "In the periods before 2017, when we required users to print QR codes before trying the technology, we were essentially creating a barrier to its widespread adoption. Now, with support on over 90% of devices, the technology can work with real-scale and high-quality 3D data without the need to download any applications.",
    "blogParagraph3Span14": "Despite the technology existing for a long time, why aren't people using it?",
    "blogParagraph3Span15": "In 2007, Apple revolutionized technology consumption by combining portable storage, operating systems, and 3G. In the following 15 years, technology evolved rapidly with contributions from different brands. The increase in the number of camera lenses and the improved graphics capabilities of processors have advanced the technology and made it more affordable.",
    "blogParagraph3Span16": "In a device support study we conducted for one of Turkey's largest e-commerce companies, we found that 89% of the devices used support AR technology. In users who have certain basket sizes and buying habits, we see that 96% of their devices support AR. Among our existing customers, we observe nearly 50% usage of AR in certain products with suitable UI/UX and informative designs.",
    "blogParagraph3Span17": "In the white goods category, such as TVs and refrigerators, and in the furniture category, we see that 40% of visitors use the AR option for 3-seater sofas, TV consoles, wardrobes, and beds. For items like bedside tables, watches, phones, and vacuum cleaners, we see that the time spent in 3D is quite high, but the transition to AR is less than 10%.",
    "blogParagraph3Span18": "Taking a broader perspective, with a well-designed 'View in Your Home' AR service, we observe an average preference rate of over 25%. Among customers who achieve positive conversions, we see that 37.5% of them have tried AR. Considering all this data, we anticipate that AR technology has entered a new phase, and companies that do not transition to this technology within the next year will lose their pioneering advantage. We believe that many companies, including e-commerce websites and mobile apps, will complement their digitization efforts with 3D and AR technology.",
    "blogParagraph3Span19": "Who should invest in AR technology and why?",
    "blogParagraph3Span20": "With the increasing use of smart devices, our customers now reach us through our mobile pages or applications. When the target audience is B2C, we see that over 80% of visitors come through mobile devices. Therefore, brands prioritize becoming Mobile-First, meaning they focus on mobile first and foremost.",
    "blogParagraph3Span21": "It is a rational observation that brands will direct their investments in this area as the use of smart phones, each of which is a technological marvel, continues to rise. In 2021, e-commerce turnover in Turkey reached 381 billion TL, accounting for 18% of total e-commerce. By 2030, we can say that this figure will exceed 40%, and considering unsuitable products and services for transformation, online commerce will practically surpass offline commerce. Looking at the future of commerce, which is shifting towards advanced devices and online channels, we no longer need additional data on the importance of providing our customers with an online product experience.",
    "blogParagraph3Span22": "In the online product experience, it is crucial to provide the visitor coming to our application or website with a 360Â° experience of the product, enable understanding of its physical characteristics, and personalize it. Providing the 'View at Home' service that cannot be achieved in offline commerce will certainly increase our sales and give competitive advantage to companies that adapt to the transition to online.",
    "blogParagraph3Span23": "Although the interest in the phenomenon of Metaverse, which experienced a surge in 2022, has decreased due to the lack of widespread device usage and disappointments in other co-evolving innovations, the decrease in the cost of devices and the increase in visual quality, completion of investments by major brands, and the increase in widespread consumption content created will make Metaverse become a part of our lives as expected. Companies can use their digitalization investments in AR technology as content in the Metaverse as well. Therefore, RealWorld Metaverse, also known as AR, is the most reasonable entry and transformation step for companies to exist in these areas.",
    "blogParagraph3Span24": "The Golden Age of Augmented Reality?",
    "blogParagraph3Span25": "At Sugar, we have been offering AR technology to our brands for 5 years. We have witnessed and adapted our products to this flow by updating them as AR progressed from marker-based to freely working on certain devices, then supporting AR in mobile applications of all devices, web-based app-free AR, and subsequently augmenting the reality of every field and object learned with artificial intelligence. The revolutionary progress in AR technology over the past 5 years has been achieved thanks to technology giants developing devices, operating systems, SDK libraries, and code development tools.",
    "blogParagraph3Span26": "Among these technology giants, we can mention Google, Apple, Snapchat, TikTok, Meta, Microsoft, and Niantic. So, how can the investment of these companies in AR technology be binding for a brand? Let's explain with an example.",
    "blogParagraph3Span27": "If a brand that obtains 50% of e-commerce traffic from search engines, advertising, and social media is listed by Google, being able to display 3D versions of products instead of images, allowing customers to try them at home, and prioritizing companies that provide this feature will have a significant impact.",
    "blogParagraph3Span28": "Let's not consider our previous sentence as a futuristic interpretation or assumption anymore. Google now offers 3D versions of products in the shoe and furniture categories to customers, and e-commerce websites that have this data are given priority in listings. Google and meta ads are also presented to customers in 3D using AR technology. When ads are published in 3D, they have a 45% higher success rate in recalling customers compared to 2D images.",
    "blogParagraph3Span29": "We are concluding this blog post here, but in the continuation of our series, we will explain in more detail how AR technology will become more widespread with the investments of tech giants. You can reach me through my LinkedIn profile or the Contact page. We are always ready to answer your questions and support your company's product digitization efforts.",

    "paragraphHeader7": "What is Apple's Vision Pro, the first 3D camera combining Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality technologies, and how does it affect digital transformation?",
    "blogParagraph4Span1": "As with all disciplines, the field of interior design has been constantly shaped by digital transformation and has utilized different presentation techniques throughout history to sustain the concept of design. It has been observed that computer technologies began to be reflected in interior design in the 1990s.",
    "blogParagraph4Span2": "Interior designers started to approach their designs more easily with computer support, reducing errors and deficiencies in the design process, increasing efficiency, and then augmented reality emerged as part of the digital transformation. Augmented Reality technology, which is a part of this digital transformation, has revolutionized the field of design.",
    "blogParagraph4Span3": "Augmented Reality is formed by placing a virtual component onto a real space or an object within a space (Azuma, 1994). Augmented Reality provides an increase in perceptual quality without disconnecting the user from the perceived world.",
    "blogParagraph4Span4": "In the field of interior design, Augmented Reality/See At Home technology prevents potential losses in terms of time and cost by showcasing various variations of materials used in the design to both manufacturers and users. In this regard, Augmented Reality/See At Home technology is considered as a new design approach for interior design.",
    "blogParagraph4Span5": "Augmented Reality technology has the potential to actively serve an interior designer within their working area (Wang, 2009). AR technology allows an interior designer and user to view the designed furniture in 360 degrees, make quick decisions regarding details such as material variations, and then virtually experience the design with the user.",
    "blogParagraph4Span6": "The 3D models experienced with Augmented Reality technology and the realism of components such as lighting, color, and material alleviate design communication. Augmented Reality technology, which has become one of the digital presentation methods of interior design today, is preferred for the following reasons:",
    "blogParagraph4Span7": "Another aspect that enables the preference of Augmented Reality technology is its ability to apply the design with an existing material in terms of color, material, or texture. The Augmented Reality presentation method not only has a realistic feature but also allows animation. Thus, the design is examined in all aspects.",
    "blogParagraph4Span8": "AR technology is an innovative and exciting tool that can be used in interior design to improve the design process and help clients better understand the final design. By using AR technology, designers can create a more immersive and engaging experience for their clients.",
    "blogParagraph4Span9": "In addition, AR technology can enhance communication between designers and clients. By using AR technology, interior designers can show their clients how their designs will look, preventing potential communication problems and facilitating a more collaborative and successful design process. When clients have a clear understanding of what to expect, they will be more satisfied with the final result. As an interior designer, I believe that AR technology will continue to play an important role in the future of the design industry.",
    "blogParagraph4Span10": "Interior designers can use Augmented Reality technology to place furniture and accessories virtually in a space. With Augmented Reality, users can better understand how the physical products will look and how much space they will occupy before placing them. This experience provides a realistic concept presentation and facilitates design feedback and purchase decisions for both interior designers and users.",
    "blogParagraph4Span11": "Augmented Reality technology has the potential to impact an extended environment, from designers to users, furniture retailers to manufacturers, and in recent years, it has become a growing trend as many industries embrace it as a tool to enhance customer experiences. It has been observed that displaying a virtual furnishing in a physical space through Augmented Reality can change retail habits. Furniture retailers can promote their new products with Augmented Reality technology, reduce return rates, increase product sales, and attract new customers. Specifically, Augmented Reality applications developed for designers and users have a profound influence on furniture designs. In recent years, with the digital transformation, users have shown a greater interest in interacting with Augmented Reality technology on smart devices (Schall, 2013). Thus, we can predict that AR technology will reach more users every day and become more permanently integrated into daily life.",
    "blogParagraph4Span12": "AR technology can also be used as a marketing tool to attract potential customers. Businesses utilizing AR technology can create engaging and interactive advertisements that capture the attention of their target audience. It is known that Augmented Reality ads are more effective than traditional ads in terms of increasing brand awareness and customerengagement. In conclusion, AR technology has a significant impact on consumer purchase decisions. By providing a more immersive and interactive shopping experience, it reduces the risk of purchasing products that may not meet customers' needs.",
    "blogParagraph4Span14": "During this year's annual WWDC event, Apple introduced Vision Pro as part of its new flagship product line. The initial announcements about this ultra-high-resolution imaging system indicated that Vision Pro is Apple's first spatial computer. It is expected that this cutting-edge technology will be a significant step forward in advancing digital transformations. Vision Pro's camera is equipped with LiDAR sensors that can capture precise depth data and map the environment in 3D.",
    "blogParagraph4Span15": "One of the most significant advantages of using Vision Pro is the ability for interior designers to collaborate with clients in real-time. This allows clients to contribute their ideas and perspectives to the project, working together with the interior designer to clarify their needs and expectations, resulting in a more harmonious and effective design process.
